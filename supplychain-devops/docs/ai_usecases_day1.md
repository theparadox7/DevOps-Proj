# AI Use Cases in Supply Chain + DevOps

## 1. Predictive Maintenance
- **Description**: AI models analyze IoT sensor data (temperature, vibration, usage cycles) from supply chain machinery and predict failures before they happen.  
- **Tools/Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, MLflow.  
- **Business Value**: Reduces downtime, lowers maintenance costs, and extends equipment lifespan.

## 2. Automated Scaling in DevOps
- **Description**: AI monitors traffic and system load, then predicts future demand to auto-scale infrastructure (containers, VMs, Kubernetes pods).  
- **Tools/Libraries**: Kubernetes HPA, Prometheus, OpenAI API.  
- **Business Value**: Optimizes resources, saves costs, and ensures uptime during demand spikes.

## 3. Anomaly Detection in Supply Chain Data
- **Description**: AI detects unusual patterns in orders, shipments, or system logs that may indicate fraud, cyberattacks, or system malfunctions.  
- **Tools/Libraries**: Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM), PyOD library, TensorFlow Autoencoders.  
- **Business Value**: Prevents fraud, enhances security, and builds customer trust.
