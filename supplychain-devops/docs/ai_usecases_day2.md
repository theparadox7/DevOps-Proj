# AI Use Cases for Supply Chain APIs – Day 2

## 1. Anomaly Detection in Inventory
- **Goal:** Detect unusual patterns in stock levels (e.g., sudden drops due to theft, misplacement, or errors).  
- **Integration:**  
  - Expose an API `/inventory/anomalies` that uses an AI model to analyze inventory transactions.  
  - Alerts raised if stock movements deviate from historical norms.

---

## 2. Predictive Stock Forecasting
- **Goal:** Anticipate future demand for products and optimize reordering.  
- **Integration:**  
  - API endpoint `/inventory/forecast` provides predictions for the next 7–30 days.  
  - Uses machine learning models trained on sales history, seasonality, and trends.  
  - Helps prevent overstocking/understocking.

## 3. Smart Reorder Recommendations
- **Goal:** Automatically generate supplier reorder suggestions.  
- **Integration:**  
  - `/inventory/reorder` API consumes AI-driven insights.  
  - Combines stock levels, supplier lead time, and predicted demand.  
  - Can trigger automated emails or ERP updates.

## 4. Chatbot for Inventory Queries
- **Goal:** Make inventory insights more accessible.  
- **Integration:**  
  - `/inventory/assistant` API powered by NLP.  
  - Example: *"Which items will run out this week?"* → AI model responds with precise stock and forecast data.

## Future Extension
These AI-driven microservices could run as independent Docker containers and communicate with the core Django app via REST APIs, making the system modular and scalable.
